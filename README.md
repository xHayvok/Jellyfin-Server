# Jellyfin-Server
Describing my Jellyfin Server setup to make maintenance easier. This repository could hopefully be used to setup a clone of my exact server, in the case something catastrophic happens.

## Server setup
The actual hardware on either of these servers has little to no relevance to the scope of this repository, however it will be noted in (make/add file outlining hardware used)
#### Server 1 (minecraft)
This server is running Debian 12(?) with no desktop environment.
Nicknamed "minecraft" as this was originally used as just a minecraft server for friends. I wont go into detail about the actual minecraft server as its irrelevant to Jellyfin, how ever it was initially setup following [this tutoial](https://youtu.be/bAGTwBURBXc?si=ozyF0t9Y1e66vMRb).
Going forward "minecraft" or "minecraft server" will refer to the physical server itself, and not the minecraft world currently running on it.
#### Server 2 (qvex)
This server is running Debian 12(?) with a default desktop environment for not other reason than I thought I might use it in the future.
Nicknamed "qvex" because I wanted something easy to remember and hard to confuse with anything else.
This server is effectively just a NAS, but also does any downloading and file organizing required for my libraries.
